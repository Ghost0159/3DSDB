## How does it work?

# How is it any different from 3dsdb.com?

As stated by @noirscape ```3dsdb was a scene dump list tracker, it didnt so much track eshop games, as it did dumps made by the various scene dumpers (aka it tracked .3ds files)```

This db lists all the games which are available on the eshop along with information about the title.

## Wait isn't this PIRACY?

No its not, there is nothing related to piracy here.
